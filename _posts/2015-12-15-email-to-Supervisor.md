Hey guys,

I decided to summarize what I've learned during the process of *"Sending a PhD Application Letter to a Supervisor"*. I hope you find this summarization helpful. Don't hesitate to leave  a comment and share your idea.

Thanks,
Farzad.

## General Notes
- The first contact should not be a spam letter, that is, a letter that you could easily have sent to 1000 faculty members worldwide, and probably did.:
	- It is addressed to "Dear Professor" and does not mention the project name or the university, even though you think my work is wonderful and desperately want to work with me.
	- The letter gives no indication that the writer has spent even a few minutes looking at the online materials related to my work.
	- First take some time to find out what kind of research the supervisor really do.
	- Do your homework.  Then write me a brief letter, making specific reference to all of that.
- Tell about yourself and graduate major and also, for what term you will be applying to and university name.
- Make clear what you are asking.
	- Don't beat about the bush with "I'm interested in your research" or "I'd like to become involved". State clearly that you're interested in doing a PhD, and that you are interested in having them as a supervisor. If you're not sure that they are the right supervisor, it's okay to say so. "Your work on xxx and yyy led me to think you might be a suitable supervisor. I'd like to discuss my work so far with you with a view to potential supervision."
- Make the funding situation clear.
	- "Once I've found a supervisor, I'm hoping to apply for a scholarship through ..."
- Show that you are serious and well qualified.
- Show that you have done thorough research and utilized all the freely available information on the website.
- Show that you are familiar with the professor’s work.
- Show that you respect the professor’s time.
- Attach a CV, transcript, and a paper you've done
- Check with the time-zone before sending the email.
	- This is to ensure that your email is probably the latest one to reach his/her office when he/she comes to the office.
- Send a reminder in the same thread after one week of requesting response to be assured of your mail not skipping the Professor's sight somehow.
- Sometimes mailing the PhD students of the professor is more beneficial than mailing the professor itself.
- To sum up all of the above: You don't need to be great at research (there are further milestones to demonstrate that), but you should be able to show that you have the capability of doing research.

Dear Prf. Dr. XXX
I have graduated from University of Amirkabir-Iran in Nuclear engineering-MSc level concentrating in the field of "Application of Radiation" research. 
I have been studying radiation detectors include HPGe and NaI (Tl) detectors to create(better say "modify" if it is not actually a creation but rather a modification of an existing model) and develop a valid simulation models for them based on experimental results I had already in hand considering from my master thesis` research and results
I would like to continue my research mainly in the fields of "Medical Application of Radiation" including those used in Radiotherapy, Radio- diagnostic and medical dosimetery procedures. Regarding your excellent research background and reference publications in XXXX group, I believe that joining your group will help me to improve my knowledge in the same field. I would like to ask you whether there is any available PhD position in your group for Spring 2016 and whether I have the chance to join your group

Dear professor

I am an MSc graduate student in medical physics at Tehran University of Medical Science (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. I studied the effect of radiation and nano particles on cancer cells during my thesis. After graduation I work as a medical physicist in Yazd radiation oncology center, which helped me to learn more about radiotherapy, as well as working in interdisciplinary work environments. As a medical physicist, I also do clinical tasks and work on practical research projects in our department.
Beyond my research successes (including 2 conference proceedings and 3 journal articles to date), I have actively participated in workshops and congresses in my hometown country. I have also taken many relevant courses, which have helped me to enhance my capabilities. So, when I visited your research group website, I found that my research interests in line with you. I found a great interest on IMRT, IGRT and 4D treatment planning as advanced precise radiotherapy methods and eager to do research in these areas. Thus, I am quite interested in the ongoing research program at your institute.
I would like to know if there is any chance for me to pursue my PhD under your supervision. Please kindly consider my CV attached to this e-mail for more information. I look forward to hearing from you.
Best,

I am writing to inquire about the announced PhD positions in X, announced on your web page. 

I graduated from the University of Tehran, the 1th-ranked university of Iran, with an MSc degree in Electrical Engineering, Control Systems. Briefly, the focus of my master's thesis was on the design of an emotional observer-based controller with application to robotics.

I read [1,2] to know more about your work on observer design in which I'm currently preparing a paper to submit to EJC. I've also read [2] to get a general overview of the battery modeling. This paper really interested me in the first part of the project, failure modeling. Besides, I have a strong background in the area of nonlinear control systems as well as data-driven fault detection plans. Thus, I believe that I'm a good fit for the position, and in response to the announcement, I sent my CV attached to you for your assessment in case the position is not filled.

I would be grateful if you could take a look at the CV and let me know upon your evaluation.

Thanks for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
